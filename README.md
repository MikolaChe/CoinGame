I came up with a console game on Kotlin - Coins.
The program randomly increases or decreases the number of coins in your wallet with each move. And if the wallet accumulates 20 coins in total, you win - and get a bonus equal to the number of moves. And if the number of coins in the wallet becomes zero - then you lose and become bankrupt.
